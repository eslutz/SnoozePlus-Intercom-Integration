# Performance Optimizations & Memory Leak Prevention

This document outlines the performance optimizations and memory leak prevention measures implemented in this PR.

## üöÄ Performance Improvements

### 1. Database Connection Pool Enhancements

**Location**: `src/config/db-config.ts`

**Improvements**:
- Added `getPoolMetrics()` function to expose connection pool statistics
- Implemented `checkDatabaseHealth()` with retry logic (3 attempts with 1s delay)
- Added `closePool()` for graceful database shutdown
- Enhanced monitoring with detailed pool event logging

**Benefits**:
- Better visibility into connection pool performance
- Improved reliability with retry logic for transient connection failures
- Proper resource cleanup during shutdown

### 2. Memory-Safe Message Scheduler

**Location**: `src/utilities/scheduler-utility.ts`

**Improvements**:
- Created `MessageScheduler` class with proper job lifecycle management
- Automatic cleanup of completed jobs every minute
- Preventive cleanup for long-scheduled jobs (24+ hours)
- Graceful shutdown with proper job cancellation
- Memory usage monitoring with `getActiveJobCount()` and job info methods

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates memory leaks from accumulating completed jobs
- Better memory management for long-running applications
- Proper resource cleanup during shutdown
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities

### 3. Enhanced Graceful Shutdown

**Location**: `src/app.ts`

**Improvements**:
- Implemented proper shutdown sequence: HTTP server ‚Üí scheduler ‚Üí database ‚Üí logger
- Comprehensive error handling during shutdown
- Proper resource cleanup order to prevent hanging processes

**Benefits**:
- Prevents resource leaks during application restarts
- Ensures data consistency during shutdown
- Faster, more reliable deployment cycles

### 4. Enhanced Health Check Endpoint

**Location**: `src/controllers/healthcheck-controller.ts`

**Improvements**:
- Added database pool metrics to health check response
- Included scheduler status (active job count)
- Structured JSON response with timestamps

**Benefits**:
- Better monitoring and observability
- Early detection of performance issues
- Operational visibility into resource usage

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Database Pool Metrics

The `/healthcheck/db-healthcheck` endpoint now provides:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": {
    "connected": true,
    "pool": {
      "totalCount": 5,
      "idleCount": 3,
      "waitingCount": 0
    }
  },
  "scheduler": {
    "activeJobs": 2
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-07-01T03:03:36.336Z"
}
```

### Scheduler Monitoring

Available methods:
- `messageScheduler.getActiveJobCount()` - Current number of scheduled jobs
- `messageScheduler.getJobInfo(messageId)` - Details about specific job
- `messageScheduler.getAllJobsInfo()` - Information about all scheduled jobs

## üîç Memory Leak Prevention

### Before
- Jobs accumulated indefinitely in memory
- No cleanup mechanism for completed jobs
- Potential memory growth over time
- No proper shutdown handling

### After  
- Automatic cleanup every 60 seconds
- Proactive cleanup for long-scheduled jobs
- Proper job cancellation during shutdown
- Memory-bounded job tracking

## üéØ Performance Impact

### Memory Usage
- **Scheduler**: Eliminated unbounded memory growth from job accumulation
- **Database**: Proper connection pool management prevents connection leaks
- **Shutdown**: Clean resource disposal prevents memory retention

### Response Times
- **Health Checks**: Enhanced with retry logic for better reliability
- **Database**: Connection pool statistics provide better monitoring
- **Logging**: Maintained existing performance while adding structured logging

### System Stability
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup sequence prevents hanging processes
- **Resource Management**: Better lifecycle management for all background processes
- **Error Recovery**: Retry logic improves resilience to transient failures

## üß™ Verification

### Manual Testing
1. **Application Startup**: ‚úÖ Verified scheduler and database initialization
2. **Health Checks**: ‚úÖ Tested enhanced health check endpoints
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: ‚úÖ Verified proper cleanup sequence
4. **Job Scheduling**: ‚úÖ Confirmed recurring job scheduling works

### Key Logs Observed
- `Recurring job scheduled successfully` - Scheduler working
- `Database health check failed after all retries` - Retry logic working
- `Message scheduler shutdown complete` - Graceful shutdown working
- `Database connection pool closed` - Pool cleanup working

## üìà Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Metrics export to monitoring systems (Prometheus, etc.)
- Configurable cleanup intervals
- Advanced job prioritization
- Connection pool auto-scaling
- Performance benchmarking tools
